There are times when your answer is a floating point that contains undesired amount of digits after decimal. Here, we'll learn how to get a precise answer out of a floating number. You are given two floating numbers a and b. You need to output a/b and decimal precision of a/b upto 3 places after decimal point.
Note: You may use System.out.format()

Example 1:

Input:
5.43 2.653

Output:
2.046739 2.047
Example 2:

Input:
3.25 2.5

Output:
1.3 1.300

class Geeks{
    
    static void printInFormat(float a, float b){
        float result = a/b;
        System.out.printf(result +" "+ "%.3f",result);
        
        // Your code here to print upto 3 decimal places
        
    }    
    
}
