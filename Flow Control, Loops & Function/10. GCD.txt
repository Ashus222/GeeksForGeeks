Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find the GCD of  A and B.
The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that can divide both A and B perfectly.

Example 1:

Input:
A = 6
B = 9
Output:
3
Explanation:
After 3 there is no number that can
divide both 6 and 9 perfectly.
Example 2:

Input:
A = 10
B = 15
Output: 
5
Explanation:
5 is the greatest common divisor of
10 and 15.

public static int gcd(int a, int b){

    int ans = 1;
    int x = Math.min(a,b);
    for(int  i =1;i<=x ;i++){
        if(a % i == 0 && b % i== 0){
            ans  = i;
        }
    }
    return ans;
    //System.out.print(ans);

        
}
